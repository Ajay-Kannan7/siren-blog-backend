If you are thinking of becoming a manager or administrator to a technical enterprise, a degree in computer science or information and computer sciences could provide you with the background needed to achieve your goals. If you are thinking about becoming a researcher in a technical field, information and computer sciences could provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.Computer science is a dynamic and rapidly growing area that has become an integral part of the world that we live in today. Having a degree in this field will provide you with a deep understanding of theories and emerging technologies. This knowledge and experience will allow you to develop cutting-edge solutions that address today’s challenges. When applied in an interdisciplinary fashion, students can also draw on their other areas of interest such as biology, business, cyber security, economics, engineering, information assurance, languages and linguistics, mathematics, physics, public policy, etc., to address a wider range of complex issues.",

A React component can be anything in your web application like a Button, Text, Label, or Grid.But as React's popularity is grown, its ecosystem has also grown to cover various use cases.You can generate a static site with React using tools like Gatsby. You can use React Native to build mobile apps. You can even create Desktop applications using a tool like Electron, which can run on mac and windows with React.js technology.React also supports server rendering of its components using tools like Next.js. You can also use React.js to create a virtual reality website and 360 experiences using React VR.You can use React in your existing apps too. React was designed keeping this in mind. You can change a small part of your existing application by using React, and if that change works, then you can start converting your whole application into React.js.

Your assignments are graded, so you are held to the same standard as the actual Harvard students. All of this is, incredibly, available completely for free.The course starts from the very basics, explaining binary and using the visual, block based programming language Scratch before moving on to C. The difficulty ramps up very quickly from there, with in depth discussions on how the computer processes the code, how information is stored in memory and what data structures are. It then moves on to HTML, Javascript and Python. By the end you are running a web server and pulling data from APIs.As someone who learned programming through online courses I have always wondered if I am missing out on something by not studying the more theoretical modules that university students do. Despite only being an intro, this course helped give me a much better idea of what a computer is doing with the code I write and address some of this self doubt I had.",

To the uninitiated, this is a savory rice cake that is made by steaming a fermented mixture of rice and pulses.Though the idli is today recognized as a south-Indian delicacy, it may have originated elsewhere. Many believe that the idli came to India between 800-1200CE from Indonesia where it is known as a kedli. Given the many links between south Indian rulers and Indonesian rulers, this is not very hard to believe.Others believe that Arab traders introduced the Indian coasts to idlis. These Arab traders had strict dietary norms and hence instead of eating the local food which may not have been halaal, they ate flattened rice balls with a coconut paste.",
